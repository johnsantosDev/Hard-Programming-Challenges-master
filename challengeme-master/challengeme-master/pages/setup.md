## Setup
Fork the [development repository](https://github.com/david35008/Challengeme-Development) to your account. clone it to your machine and go to the project folder.
### Server setup
from the root directory:
- run `cd server`
- run `npm i`
- depending on the changes you want to work on you may need to add certain parameters to the [`.env`](../server/.example.env) file for [certain systems](#env-parameters) to work.
### Client setup
- run `cd ../client`
- run `npm i`

### DataBase setup
the project uses [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) to exchange information with a **MySQL** DataBase.
to set it up locally:

- create new db for development - default name is `challenge` (can change by [`.env`](../server/.example.env) file). Also add to `.env` all the required data to connect to the database.
- run structure migrations: `npm run migrate`
- run test data seeds: `npx sequelize db:seed:all`

# Env Parameters
- Change the `.example.env` file's name to `.env` if you haven't already.

- Change `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env` file to your github token, you can learn more about that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- Change `GITHUB_REPO` in `.env` file to your github forked repository
- Change `IP_ADDRESS` in .env file to your client ip address
- Change `SUVELOCITY_MAIL` in .env file to an email account you want to use for testing.
- Change `SUVELOCITY_PASSWORD` in .env file to the email's password. you can read about it [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en-GB). You are not limited to Gmail of course.
- Change all tokens in `.env` file to some random characters (used as encryption keys)
  ```javascript
  REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET
  RESET_PASSWORD_TOKEN
  ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
  EMAIL_TOKEN_SECRET
  ```
### Startup
Server:
- `cd server `
- `npm run dev` - nodemon hot reloads  

Client:
- `cd client`
- `npm start`


### Only On first time - init

- Enable **GitHub actions** in your forked repo - go to https://github.com/{your-user}/{your-repo}/actions and press "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"

- Github has many issues when it comes to actions and forked repositories.    
If you need to add any change for files under [`.github/workflows`](../.github/workflows), in this step we just need to ensure Github is aware of those changes ðŸ¥µ.  
You may need add a newline at the end of the file or change the name of the folder, then  commit it and change it back - in order to ensure the changes are noticed by Github.
- Create .env file from example and fill the params (repo name / access token)
- You should [create an access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) from a github user who has admin permission on the forked repo - if you don't, your team leader probably does.
